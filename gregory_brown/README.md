# Learning from our elders

Pretty much every modern computing problem you can think of was considered (and
often solved) by some stuffy old academic back in the 1970s or 1980s.
Unfortunately, because we are under constant pressure to stay on top of what is
*new*, we have lost touch with many *old* ideas that can help us
build better software.

In this talk, I will share examples of useful ideas that were formulated
before Ruby was even a twinkle in Matz's eye. Each and every idea will be
presented in a way that a Ruby programmer can understand, even if the original
sources were written in Smalltalk, Lisp, C++, obscure mathematical notation,
hieroglyphics, or cuneiform.

This is a topic I've already written about quite a bit, but I can promise that
this talk will be full of all new ideas and examples. But to get an idea of what
you're in for, check out the following articles:

* Thoughts on "Arguments and Results" ([part 1][pr-2.14], [part 2][pr-2.15])
* Criteria for disciplined inheritance ([part 1][pr-3.7], [part 2][pr-3.8])
* [Rocket Science and the Law of Demeter][pr-5.2][pr-5.2]

## About me (Gregory Brown)

I run the [Practicing Ruby journal](http://practicingruby.com), and have been
active in the Ruby community since 2004. While I used to attend conferences like
crazy, I'm now mostly hanging out at home with my wife and son, and generally
enjoying family life. Fortunately, some of my family is in Florida!

If you're fond of the past: I founded Mendicant University and taught
classes there for two years, was the original author of the Prawn PDF library, 
wrote the "Ruby Best Practices" book for O'Reilly, got a Ruby Hero award in 
2010, and I may have also earned a perfect attendance certificate back in the 
5th grade. I am especially fond of that last accomplishment, but it may not
actually be true.
